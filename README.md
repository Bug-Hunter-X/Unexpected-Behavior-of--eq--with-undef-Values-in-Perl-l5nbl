This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Perl related to comparing 'undef' values using the 'eq' operator. The bug.pl file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.pl offers a corrected version.  The core issue is that a direct string comparison against 'undef' doesn't produce intuitive results. The solution utilizes defined() to explicitly check for definedness before attempting a comparison.
